Getting started
===============

This documentation gives an overview over my code for the final project in the EPP- and the scientific computing course, University of Bonn, winter term 2020/21.
The emphasis is on four aspects:

- Develop a working, stable and relatively fast python implementation for the adaptive lasso, which is currently not available to the best of my knowledge
- Run a simulation study to benchmark several post-model-selection inference procedures, including the adaptive lasso
- Apply the adaptive lasso to a real-world dataset (LISS) to improve the understanding of vaccination attitudes
- Conduct a small latent profile analysis to identify latent subpopulations (regarding vaccination attitudes) based on various sets of variables from the LISS panel
