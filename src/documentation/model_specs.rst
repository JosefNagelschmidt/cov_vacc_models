Model specifications
********************

The directory *src.model_specs* contains `JSON <http://www.json.org/>`_ files with model specifications.
Currently, all files are specifications for the latent profile analysis (LPA) in the real data part of the project (EPP course).


- `lpa_aux_set.json` specifies auxiliary variables that are analyzed in the second-stage of the latent profile analysis, i.e. after the latent profiles have been assigned.
- `lpa_estimator_specs.json` specifies which parametrizations of gaussian mixture models are considered in the first-stage of the LPA.
- `lpa_var_set_x.json` specifies the main variables on which the latent profiles (i.e. gaussian mixtures) are trained via the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. I consider four reasonable sets of variables.
- the `lpa_optimal_params_set_x.json` files are going to be generated by the output of the task `./src/data_management/task_lpa_get_optimal_params.py`, which takes  the results of `./src/analysis/task_lpa_analysis.py`, i.e. BIC values for all types of gaussian mixture models. These files therefore summarize which gaussian mixtures performed best in terms of BIC values. For each set of variables we have one optimal model.
