Latent profile analysis
=======================

The results of the LPA are summarized in a jupyter notebook.

The corresponding files are:

- `lpa_summary.ipynb`


Sparse modelling (adaptive lasso)
=================================

The results of adaptive lasso applied on real-data (LISS) are summarized in a jupyter notebook.

The corresponding files are:

- `sparse_modelling_results_real_data.ipynb`


Scientific computing benchmarking
=================================

The results of the simulation study, as well as an glimpse into the process of developing a lasso implementation (via coordinate descent) are summarized in two jupyter notebooks.

The corresponding files are:

- `adaptive_lasso_implementation.ipynb` guides through some tricks on the path to develop a functioning and fast lasso implementation for moderate dimensions
- `sim_study_results.ipynb` presents the results of the benchmarking of various post-model-selection inference procedures
