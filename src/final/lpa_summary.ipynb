Apparently, it is also not too sceptical about science in general (in its own perception). One would expect that its group members would show low values for their intention to take a vaccine.\n",

Also the other categories it scores higher than any other group, but with less distance to the average of others. One would expect that its group members would show high values for their intention to take a vaccine.\n",

The high standard errors here, however, reflect high uncertainty due to the small amount of participants in this group. A subsequent analysis should analyse this group and its persistence in more detail.\n",
